	<h1>My Life</h1>
	<p>I was born. My dad was a king, so I automatically was cool. Later, though, when I was a teenager, I became kind of a jerk. First I had the butcher's boy killed for no reason. Then when my dad died I became the worst king ever. My uncle Tyrion saved my life, but I still hate him. Who am I? Why Joffrey Baratheon of course! King of the Seven Kingdoms by day, but humble student of Startup Institute Frontend Development by night.
