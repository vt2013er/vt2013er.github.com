	<h1>My Life</h1>
	<p>I was born. My dad was a king, so I automatically was cool. Later, though, when I was a teenager, I became kind of a jerk. First I had the butcher's boy killed for no reason. Then when my dad died I became the worst king ever. My uncle Tyrion saved my life, but I still hate him. Who am I? Why Joffrey Baratheon of course! King of the Seven Kingdoms by day, but humble student of Startup Institute Frontend Development by night. </p>
<h2>My pretty face</h2>

<p> Ok, so I'm actually really to busy ruling the Seven Kingdoms. The Lannisters and Starks are fighting, my Hound has run away, and I've got my mother Cersei and my uncle Tywin to deal with. But I'll send you my lacky Jonathan Hastings in my place. Make him work hard. Here's his pic, so you can recognize my indentured slave.</p>
